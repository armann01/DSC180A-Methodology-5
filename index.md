What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
I found it super interesting to learn how people can trick AI models, like using clever prompts to make them do things they aren’t supposed to (jailbreaking). It’s fascinating to see how small tweaks in the way questions are asked can mess with even the most advanced systems.

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
Next quarter, I’d like to dig into how we can train models to recognize and stop jailbreak attempts better. Maybe by creating tricky prompts specifically to test the model and then teaching it to handle those without messing up regular, harmless conversations.

What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
One thing I’d change is making the process for testing jailbreaks more flexible. Instead of sticking to a fixed list of prompts, I’d try using an approach where the system learns and adapts to new tricks people come up with on the fly.

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I’d like to try methods to better understand how the model "thinks" when it’s being tricked. Also, using tools to generate super tricky test cases could make the model’s defenses stronger and more reliable.
